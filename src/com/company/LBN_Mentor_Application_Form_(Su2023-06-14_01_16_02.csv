I've just completed my second year in the Honours Biochemistry program at McMaster University. My next step towards my career is to focus on teaching as I love it so much. I successfully completed level 1 course named Math1LS3 that allowed me to analyze real data and explore mathematical models with Python using a Jupyter Notebook. The Statistical Methods of Science (Stats 2B03) course has allowed me to obtain a good understanding of basic fundamental ideas of statistics/math. After completing this course, I’m able to carry out basic statistical calculations by hand, and interpret and understand computer output, and its relation to hand calculation.
I am eager to discuss the possibility of joining your team. Please feel free to contact me for additional career details and qualifications. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

My name is Melissa. While I have not volunteered for the Learning Buddies program, I did take part in the online program called Connect Through Homework through SFU-TD's Community Engagement Centre. During this program, I led games and activities with students who were learning English or I helped a student one-on-one with their English homework. We'd play games like I Spy, Scattergories, or Kahoot. 

What I liked about that program was that I could see the same faces every week, build a relationship with them, and celebrate their successes when they progressed in speaking or reading English. I was really happy even when I saw students who were shy in the beginning start to participate in games by the end. This is also why I want to volunteer with the Learning Buddies since I could support a student with whatever they struggle with and hopefully, by the end of the program, they've acquired new knowledge or are more confident in themselves.

I have walked through the emotions of cluelessness and confusion when a teacher keeps babbling on mathematical concepts; on the other hand, I have also experienced the satisfaction from finally grasping what your teacher is trying to teach. Having experienced what it feels to be on both sides of the spectrum, I believe I would be able to sympathise with a student's concerns and struggles on their learning journey.

As a student pursuing post-secondary studies, I am passionate about learning and would love to share this with children in the LBN as a means to inspire a greater motivation in learning and to help instill a greater sense of self efficacy! I believe that ensuring children feel confident in their skills and abilities is critical to the learning process and having someone there to tell them that they ""can do it"" is just as important, which is why the position of mentor is so appealing to me.

","While also volunteering at the Brenda Strafford Heart Home Network, I also interacted with and assisted many children diagnosed as being neurodivergent (with ASD and/or experiencing learning impairments). With many of these children, I helped to take care of them and introduce them to learning activities.

Some subjects were a struggle for me, especially math, when I was in my early grades. I had a passion for numbers, but that passion was limited by the lack of programs that help sustain my learning.
Only through years of self-studying with borrowed math texts from the public library did I achieve the level of understanding with numbers that I sought after as I child. The process was long, hard, and grueling. Mentors were hard to come by, with only my parents on occasion helping when they don't have their own work. Tutoring was expensive too, and not easily accessible nor affordable.
That's why I'm interested in volunteering.
Because I know how important it is to have someone guide you through the process, having had the same experience as many kids in your program.
So many mathematical concepts only became clear to my after my parents spent the time to explain it. Without them, an idea that would've taken a mere 10 minutes would've taken my child self an hour to piece together alone.
Math is such an important part in my life, or, anyone's life really. It shouldn't be locked behind paywalls or hefty prices.
Learning should be a privilege every child should be entitled to. Having free tutoring as a child would've saved countless hours of my time. I did not have this liberty when I first started my math journey, so I want to help provide it to children now.

I am currently in the 10th grade. However, I am currently enrolled in pre-calculus 12. This gives me a clearer view of the scope of the math journey, so I can give more emphasis on certain concepts I teach that will benefit the child in the long run.
I've also worked with children in the past: having a babysitting license, being part of a 'big buddy' program in my elementary school, and being part of a playground safety program (looking after children during breaks, lunch, and recess).
I am adept at mathematics. As mentioned earlier, I currently enrolled in a math course 2 years above my grade level.
I also have some qualifications, experience and awards in the math field which will be listed below:
- I am in math club
- I am part of my highschool's math team (both regional and provincial teams)

In 2017, I started my own private tutoring service where I provided math, science, and computer programming support to elementary, high school, and first-year university students. My goal was to create a comfortable learning environment to make math and science approachable for all learning styles by modifying resources to meet students' needs. I tutored both in person and online, receiving excellent client satisfaction as students' confidence and grades increased.

Last summer, I worked as a Multimedia Designer at Earth Rangers, which is a non-profit organization that educates children on environmental issues and encourages them to take action. In this role, I prepared original website and social media content such as blog posts and activities focused on the environment and conservation. I also hosted Instagram Lives called ""Craft Corner"", where I taught viewers how to make a solar-powered oven, water wheel, and windmill by repurposing household items.

Engaging in meaningful conversations and exploring individuals' unique stories and experiences brings me great joy. I find fulfillment in sharing my own experiences to inspire and connect with others. 

I want to volunteer with the LBN for many reasons: 

My primary motivation is to positively impact students' lives by helping them develop essential reading and math skills. I understand the importance of literacy and numeracy as the foundation for lifelong learning and success. As someone who has personally experienced the challenges and benefits of building a strong educational foundation, I want to help more students become confident in reading and math while discovering the joy of learning. 

Also, I am excited about connecting with students from various backgrounds and learning from their unique perspectives. Engaging with individuals from different walks of life broadens my understanding and helps me develop empathy, cultural awareness, and effective communication skills. 

Moreover, this volunteer experience will offer me invaluable personal growth. As a mentor, I believe that I will continuously learn about myself and identify my strengths and areas for improvement. The experience will enhance my adaptability to different learning styles, patience, and ability to provide tailored support to meet each student's needs. 

Lastly, I am impressed by the organization and opportunities the LBN provides. I value the chance to not only be a mentor but also to explore leadership positions such as program coordinator or executive coordinator. I appreciate the opportunity for growth and development beyond mentoring.

During my high school years, I engaged in various volunteer activities that, while not directly related to teaching, have equipped me with skills that I believe are valuable for this position. For example, I have helped with school announcements, which helped me develop strong public speaking abilities. Additionally, I have been swimming for many years; I have volunteered as a coach’s assistant, teaching juniors essential swimming skills and assisting them during practice sessions. Moreover, my passion for gaming has led me to actively engage with online communities and take on the leadership role of guiding and teaching fellow players through challenging in-game activities. I strongly believe that these experiences have prepared me for the next step in the journey.

Thank you for considering my application for the position of Literacy/Math Support volunteer at the Learning Buddies Network. Having been an English language teacher for more than 5 years, I understand the challenges that children and youth face when it comes to language barriers and literacy development. With 2 years of experience teaching at an international school that follows the British Cambridge curriculum in Macau, China, I have developed a creative approach to teaching English language arts to elementary-aged students.

As a firm believer that students learn best when they are actively engaged and when they complete tasks with their peers. In my lessons, I utilize a range of collaborative learning strategies and differentiated tasks tailored to meet each student's unique learning needs. My goal is to enhance students' confidence in learning while making the content relatable and engaging. For example, in a recent 40-min lesson on poem writing for Grade 4 students, I introduced three types of rhyme schemes and then asked each group of students to write a poem based on their ability. At the end of the class, students wrote the poem on a poster and presented it to the class. Although this lesson was not a complexly structured one, students got the opportunity to engage in meaningful small group discussions, showcased their understanding of the materials, shared opinions with peers of similar capability, and ultimately gained confidence in both writing and speaking. 

I often designed the lesson plans from scratch; they encompass reading and comprehension, writing, and speaking/presentation. I aim to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment where students feel comfortable expressing themselves and taking risks in their learning.

Aside from my teaching experience, I am deeply passionate about supporting children and youth in their literacy development. I believe that the Learning Buddies Network is an excellent platform to do so, as it provides an opportunity to integrate reading and writing into creative activities that are motivated by the kids' and youths’ interests. This approach can boost self-confidence and engagement with literacy, which is crucial for their academic and personal growth.

I am passionate about creating a supportive and inclusive learning environment that empowers students to achieve their goals. I believe that my ability to inspire students is evidenced by my own achievements, including receiving the prestigious Chancellor Award of UBC Vancouver.

My availability for 2023 is July 13th and August 19th. I am fully committed to attending the orientation training and am available during program hours. As a volunteer, I am an adaptable and open-minded team player. Thank you for considering my application.


Kind regards, 
Cynthia Chao (she/her/hers)
","I do not",,"I have been an elementary school homeroom teacher in an inclusive classroom for two years, and have experience working with students with dyslexia, dysgraphia, ASD and ADHD. 

When working with these children, my colleagues and I often delivered our lessons using the co-teaching model format. This way, the number of students that we cater in the lesson reduces, allowing us to give more one-on-one support to the inclusive students. 

To ensure that students with learning disabilities are able to achieve the objectives of the lesson, tasks often need to be accommodated or modified. For students with mild symptoms, highlighting key words and using visual aids may be sufficient. For students with more severe learning difficulties, step-by-step prompts may need to be provided, or the type of questions has to be specifically designed to match the abilities of that particular student.

Because of their unwavering support towards my academic curiosity, I was able to achieve high grades and pursue an undergraduate degree in North America from the Philippines. I would like to inspire elementary students in the same way using my academic skills and leadership experience, which is why I want to volunteer as a Reading mentor with the Learning Buddies Network.

This February, I mentored eight 6th and 7th grade students of varying skill sets in preparing for their annual school science fair within three days; I coached said students in presenting their experimental projects by providing advice on public speaking, writing, and creating visual aids. This experience trained me to adjust my mentorship style in terms of each student's needs and personality, which I intend to do similarly for my mentee.

I have also gained valuable communication experience as a leader throughout my secondary education. As the founder and president of my high school's mental health club for two years, president of my high school's theater club for one year, and president/vice president of my homeroom section for two years, I ensured that all operations were running smoothly by communicating effectively with both my fellow executive officers and members of our clubs and homeroom section. I intend to apply the communication skills I garnered in guiding my mentees through their lessons.

Lastly, as previously mentioned, I have been a consistently high achieving student throughout my primary, secondary, and now undergraduate education. I graduated high school with Honors and finished my first year of university with an 88.1% (A) average. I hope to use the study techniques and experiences I gained over the years to guide my mentee throughout their education.

Burnett Secondary School. Having just finished my LBN in Spring, I wanted to take up my role as a Maths tutor for Learning Buddies Network again as I found it very rewarding to volunteer and it helped me a lot. Not only did I learn a lot from it, but it has also been a great way to improve my ability to communicate with children and teach others, giving me a better understanding of what it takes to be a good maths tutor.I already enjoy interacting with children and I am very experienced in dealing with children as I have a younger brother of 8 years old. I often look after him, play with him and help him with his homework. I think that although the process can be a little difficult at the beginning because children will think a little differently and will be new and unique so we need to put ourselves in their shoes to figure out how to solve the maths problem, the composition of exploring good ways to have discussions with children here is something I really enjoy and look forward to.So I feel that if I am patient and methodical in guiding them, they will not find it difficult to do maths when they learn. At the same time, I also find tutoring them very interesting because they are full of energy and joy every day. This joy is often passed on to me and brings me strength, so I really enjoy interacting with the children.
I also have extensive experience in studying mathematics. My grade 10 pre-calculus was 96%, my grade 11 pre-calculus was 99%, and although I am currently in grade 11, I have completed my grade 12 pre-calculus with a 94%. The most important thing that kept me going after one semester of LBN was to see the progress of the buddies I tutored, especially when she herself felt the progress and was happy to say ""I think I am making a lot of progress"".Although I would spend a lot of time choosing and thinking about what kind of explanation would be better for the buddies to understand, and what kind of methods and games would not make the lessons boring for the buddies. But every time I hear this, I feel that all the hard work and effort I put in is worth it, and it makes me even more determined to help more students to improve their abilities and make them all feel this way. As I love learning maths myself, I hope to inspire more children to take up the subject and I also hope to improve my leadership skills by taking on the responsibility of a volunteer position. Therefore, I am very much looking forward to this volunteering opportunity and to bettering myself at LBN in the future.","Yes, outside of LBN","I've had the opportunity to hear Indigenous people speak at school.

However, society is now taking notice of these problems and is making efforts to protect Indigenous people and help them to publicise all kinds of injustices to raise awareness. Today, they have improved opportunities and environments for learning and I hope to contribute to this process.

Thank you for considering my application to volunteer with your organization! I’m enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your mission of enhancing self-esteem through improvement in academic skills and igniting a passion for learning in a safe and caring environment. I have always been passionate about education and helping others, which is why I have pursued private tutoring for two years. During this time, I worked with students of various age groups and academic levels, assisting them in mathematics, science, English, and even AP exams.

My experience as a private tutor has taught me the ability to assess the unique needs and learning styles of students, tailoring my teaching methods accordingly to ensure optimal understanding and engagement. In addition, I have developed a strong communication skill, adaptability skill, and patience. I believe I equip most, if not all, skills applicable to being a mentor in LBN.

Moreover, my experience in tutoring has taught me the importance of creating a supportive and encouraging environment for students. I strive to foster a positive atmosphere that promotes confidence, motivation, and a love for learning. I believe these qualities are crucial when working with individuals who may face educational challenges or require additional assistance.

Volunteering with your organization would not only allow me to continue making a meaningful impact in the lives of others but also provide me with an opportunity to expand my skills and knowledge in a different setting. I am excited about the prospect of working alongside a dedicated team of mentors.

Thank you for considering my application. 

Sincerely,
Grace Lee

When I was in elementary school, I was unaware of any opportunities to receive free tutoring, let alone online tutoring.

By becoming a mentor, I have the potential to help one more student who may be in a similar situation. 

Over the last 3 years of studies in my program, I have completed and excelled in several math, calculus and statistics courses. This, along with my genuine desire to make a difference in a child’s life, are reasons why I believe I would provide a meaningful experience as a Mentor to my Buddy. 

I have been staying involved in the community by volunteering with Parkinson Canada to help organize and carry out their annual events. Volunteering with LBN would allow me to continue making contributions to the community by taking advantage of my academic abilities to benefit children.

As I progress into my second year, one particular course that has captivated my interest is developmental psychology. Delving into the intricacies of how children develop and identifying the factors that may impede their growth has been an enlightening experience.

During my middle and high school years, I actively engaged in numerous volunteer opportunities centered around younger children. As an assistant basketball and soccer coach, I had the privilege of working with children aged 3 to 5, as well as middle school students. This three-year coaching experience allowed me to cultivate strong bonds with the children and their parents, providing me with valuable insights into their emotional and physical needs.

Additionally, I volunteered and spearheaded an after-school program that involved escorting children from my middle school to a special needs school. Engaging in activities, reading books, and interacting with children facing various mental and physical challenges offered a hands-on experience that greatly enhanced my leadership skills.

Moreover, while studying in Canada, I actively collaborated with my school's student union to organize and plan student wellness activities, such as movie nights and silent discos. This involvement enabled me to discover innovative and practical ways to design enjoyable experiences for a diverse range of students.

By combining my academic pursuits in psychology with my hands-on experiences working with children and organizing student activities, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of human development and the practical application of psychological principles. These experiences have reinforced my passion for psychology and motivated me to pursue further opportunities in the field.","I do not",," During my extensive volunteer work, I frequently found myself in the company of children with specific learning disabilities. These experiences provided me with invaluable insights into working with individuals diagnosed with conditions such as Asperger's Syndrome, anxiety disorders, and ADHD.

As a psychology student, I have developed a comprehensive understanding of how these learning disabilities can impact children's lives while recognizing their physical capabilities. This knowledge has equipped me with the ability to approach these children with empathy and understanding, while also acknowledging their individual strengths and abilities.

By interacting with children who face such challenges, I have witnessed firsthand the unique ways in which these learning disabilities manifest in their lives. This practical experience, combined with my academic background, has deepened my appreciation for the diverse range of needs that these children have. It has also reinforced my commitment to providing them with the support and understanding necessary to thrive and reach their full potential.

Overall, my encounters with children with learning disabilities have not only enhanced my understanding of their specific needs but also fostered my passion for advocating for inclusive environments that value and support the abilities of all individuals, regardless of their challenges.",Yes,gyiweza,ggyiweza21@gmail.com,No,,"Reading Mentor"," Second choice","First choice"," Unavailable"," Unavailable"," Unavailable","If short staffed I am willing to make the trip to BC.

It was a profoundly moving experience that left a lasting impression on me. I saw how these children desperately yearned to learn but lacked the necessary resources and opportunities. This eye-opening encounter ignited a passion to dedicate myself to helping children in need.

From that point forward, I knew that I wanted to grow up as someone who could make a difference in the lives of these children. During my time in secondary school, I actively sought out avenues where I could contribute my time and efforts to support young kids. I began volunteering at my local church, assuming responsibilities that included caring for the children, teaching them Korean, and organizing various events for their benefit. The experience was fulfilling and taught me valuable lessons about empathy, patience, and the power of education.

As I dedicated my time to the children at my church, I quickly realized that I was gaining far more from the experience than what I was giving. Witnessing the joy on their faces as they learned and grew was a rewarding experience. It reaffirmed my belief that education can transform lives and uplift communities. It also solidified my determination to continue working with children as part of my lifelong journey.

In addition to my volunteer work, I have gained five years of valuable tutoring experience. It has further enriched my understanding of children's diverse needs and learning styles. Through one-on-one interactions, I have witnessed personalized support's immense impact on a child's educational journey. This experience has equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the position I am applying for.
